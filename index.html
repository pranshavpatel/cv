        <p><em>First year CSE student at <strong><a href="https://nirmauni.ac.in/">Nirma University</a></strong>.</em></p>
        <p>My name is Pranshav Patel and I joined the institute 2 months late due to some circumstances. But now I am really motivated to learn coding and reach great heights! I have already learnt C and now I am learning web development. I have
          almost
          completed HTML and will complete CSS and JS after that!</p>

  <h3>Education</h3>
  <ul>
    <p>
      <li><strong>St.Kabir School :</strong></li> I joined this school in nursery and studied there till class 10th. That's 13 years of my life in the same school and tbh it was a pretty amazing ride!
    </p>
    <p>
      <li><strong>Puna International School :</strong></li> Then something bad happened and I joined a dummy school which really was like a dummy and believe me it was the worst decision of my life! I could have stayed in my old school and enjoyed a
      lot!
    </p>
    <p>
      <li><strong>Bothra Classes :</strong></li> For my JEE prep I went here and it was a pretty crazy ride, full of ups and downs!
